# Inference & Representation Project (Fall 2020)
This project is the work of Camille Taltas, Matthew Drnevich, Guy Davidson, and Michael Albergo. The goal of this research was to explore different transport maps from a simple probability distribution to a more complex target distribution. We studied the tradeoffs of discrete parametric and non-parametric transport maps with normalizing flows and the Stein Variational Gradient Descent algorithm and explored how the benefits of both of these maps can be found within continuous-time flows based on ordinary differential equations.
